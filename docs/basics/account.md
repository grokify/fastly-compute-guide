# Creating an Account

## Using a Free Account

To try Fastly, you can click the "Try Fastly free" button on the [Fastly homepage](https://fastly.com) which takes you to the [sign up page](https://www.fastly.com/signup/). Note, if the website recognizes that you already have an account, you will see a "Login" button instead of "Try Fastly free".

### Limitations of a Free Account

A free account is enough to launch a service using a Fastly subdomain, e.g. `<your-subdomain>.global.ssl.fastly.net`. If you wish to use your own domain, e.g. `yourdomain.com`, you must upgrade to a paid account which can be done via the Fastly Management Console.
