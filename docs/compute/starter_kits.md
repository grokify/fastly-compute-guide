# Starter Kits

## JavaScript

1. [Default starter for JavaScript](https://developer.fastly.com/solutions/starters/compute-starter-kit-javascript-default/): A basic starter kit that demonstrates routing, simple synthetic responses and overriding caching rules.
1. [Empty starter for JavaScript](https://developer.fastly.com/solutions/starters/compute-starter-kit-javascript-empty/): An empty application template for the Fastly Compute@Edge environment which simply returns a 200 OK response.
1. [Optimizely](https://developer.fastly.com/solutions/starters/optimizely-fastly-compute-starter-kit/): A basic starter kit for Fastly's Compute@Edge with Optimizely built in.

## AssemblyScript
